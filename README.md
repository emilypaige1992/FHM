Contraception Data Analysis Research Question

For the paper I’m currently working on, the title would be: “Traditional beliefs and Other Pre-determinants of likelihood to uptake modern contraceptive methods among a population of women in Haiti.”  Specifically, I’m interesting in looking at the following data analyses:

Null hypotheses: Women who believe traditional FP methods are effective (Q#34) are equally likely to:
	have used (Q#42, includes traditional and modern), 
	currently use (Q#43, sub-set of modern FP only), 
	ever use (Q#44, includes modern only) 
a contraceptive method as women who do not believe they are effective or who are uncertain.
	H_01:P_(have used either,believe traditional)=P_(have used either,don^' tbelieve traditional) (likely not as useful since includes traditional)
	H_02:P_(currently use modern,believe traditional)=P_(currently use modern,don^' tbelieve traditional)
	H_03:P_(ever used modern,believe traditional)=P_(ever used,don^' tbelieve traditional)
Q34 = main predictor
Q42-44 = outcomes

Hypotheses:  Women who believe traditional FP methods are effective (Q#34) are less likely to:
	have used (Q#42, confounded by the presence of traditional FP methods), 
	currently use (Q#43, sub-set of modern FP only), 
	ever use (Q#44, includes modern only) 
a contraceptive method as women who do not believe they are effective or who are uncertain.
	H_a1:P_(have used either,believe traditional)≠??P_(have used either,don^' tbelieve traditional) (likely not as useful since includes traditional)
	H_a2:P_(currently use modern,believe traditional)<P_(currently use modern,don^' tbelieve traditional)
	H_a3:P_(ever used modern,believe traditional)<P_(ever used,don^' tbelieve traditional)

I would then like to identify correlates of a woman’s likelihood to believe that traditional FP methods are as or more effective than modern FP methods. (Q #36)

I also would like to identify correlates of modern contraceptive uptake: current (Q#43, sub-set of modern FP only) and future (Q#44).  I would like to look at the role of demographics and other variables.  Then, I would like to identify correlates with the data stratified by “women who have children” (Q#9, if yes) and women who don’t want any more children (Q#10, if no).  
	Logistic regression model with proportion of those using modern methods with belief in traditional as predictor and consider different covariates (age, have children, education, employment, income, etc.)
